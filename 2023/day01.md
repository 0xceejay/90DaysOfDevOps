## 2022 Reflection & Welcome 2023

Hey Everyone and welcome to the 2023 edition of #90DaysOfDevOps in this Day 1 post the plan is to reflect on the 2022 edition and some statistics, feedback and ideas that we have had during the year. 

### 2022 Recap 

First of all WOW! To think that the mission I thought up on New Years Eve 2021 was to spend the first 90 days of 2022 learning and documenting that learning, basically writing some notes after watching some much smarter people than me. 

Fast forward a year, and we have some amazing numbers on the repository, I think I mentioned at least somewhere in the repository but I know I have mentioned elsewhere many times any content is worth doing if it helps even just one person, to have the numbers that we have here from stars to forks is incredible.

I firstly want to thank everyone for this and the sharing of the repository around the community and hearing that Microsoft and other massive tech vendors have shared this around their teams is humbling. 

Secondly, I would like to thank the contributers. This started out as a place to take notes and learn in public, and it wasn't until a few days in when I saw people correcting my poor spelling and grammar. (I am sure the same will happen this year) But the biggest and most amazing thing was the communnity that started to translate the repository into their native language! How amazing to think this was happening and helping non native english speakers learn more about the powers of DevOps.

### Continous Learning 

I mentioned and mention a lot that we are never done learning, if you think you are then you picked the wrong industry as things are changing all the time and at a rapid pace. 

It is for that reason we have to keep learning, learning for some is a challenge and for those people I urge you to find a medium that you enjoy. I have always enjoyed documenting something I learn like this and then getting hands-on. The premise of this project is exactly that, it is about a foundational knowledge of some of the key areas of DevOps and the tooling that achieves this, You are not going to be a graduated DevOps engineer by following along but you are going to have a better understanding of terminology and getting hands on with some technologies that maybe you do not see on a day to day basis. 

I also want to add that everyone is constantly evolving and learning, it doesn't matter if you are the CTO of a software company or a Systems Administrator wanting to learn more about automation, everyone is learning and that little imposter syndrome feeling is normal. My advice is run towards it vs running away from it and you will absolutely reap the rewards, also learn what you enjoy this makes learning more enjoyable. 


### Security focused 

For those that have been following along you will have known that the biggest area we missed out on in the 2022 edition was security aptly named DevSecOps and how we integrate security into that infinite DevOps cycle to ensure we are always thinking about security. 

In this edition we will be diving in head first to the security processes and principles as it obtains to DevSecOps heavily in this version as well as getting to some more topics that we missed off in the first round. 


### A little help from my friends 

The 2022 edition was the equivelent of writing a blog post each day. We were well over 100k words and if we were to spin this into an ebook which was an option and instructions can be found in the repository if you so wish but you would find over 700 pages of A4 paper in total. The book idea is not dead and buried and I am working on a smaller version behind the scenes that might be a nice giveaway at a conference near you along with our amazing stickers. 

Another gap for me and maybe this was the authenticity of the project was I was just starting to learn and documenting that learning journey into some of these areas. This time round I have asked some friends in the community to help. 

There are two reasons for this: 

1. I think it is important to get different perspectives across topics and also we are all going to learn best if we hear from subject matter experts in those specific topic areas. 

2. Some of the friends that will be helping here will have the oppurtunity to grow their brand and potentially even speak at events about their topics and the over project. 

You can find the 2023 authors on the opening 2023.md page with links to their bios and contact details. 

I think it is also time to be very clear about the project. Nobody is being paid to write, nobody is being paid to talk about the project. I was approached about sponsorship a number of times but the premise of this project is for it to remain impartial, free and for the community. Yes we have used some projects and products throughout but none of the companies have sponsored or had a say in what has been written. 

Finally, my employer Veeam Software, I am extremely lucky to have a company that enables me to be part of the community and to document my learnings without any interference. I don't work a traditional 9-5 and I am sure many people reading this do not either but I am free to create content like this project. 

### Resources 

Throughout the project and the previous 2022 edition you will find the resources section, this is a list of the content that I or my fellow authors have been through and if you want to learn more than you are reading here go and grab this content.

With that said let's get into things with [Day 2](day02.md).
